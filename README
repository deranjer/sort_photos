This is a simple script just for sorting photos (based on EXIF data) in current folder into folders like 
C:\Users\Administrator\Arx\date\<year>\<month>\<day>\*.jpg
<month> is in full english form (January, Feburary, etc)

Python 2.x

-- dennis(a)yurichev.com
-- deranjer(a)gmail.com

Requires dateutil and six python modules (included in download)

Options:
#set dir for original pictures
odir='/mnt/media/Pictures- OLD'

#If you want to file pictures in a new directory, specify here, make sure dir exits
move_dir=True
ndir='/mnt/media/NewPictures2'

#sort only these file ext.  Comment this line out to sort ALL file types
exts = ['.jpeg', '.jpg', '.exif', '.tiff', '.raw', '.gif', '.bmp', '.png', '.pam', '.webp', '.svg', '.rgbe']

#exclude dirs here (if folder contains tree structure) that you don't want moved/sorted
excludes = ['test test',  'atest', '2005', '2006', '2007']

#If you want to move pictures with NO/BROKEN metadata to the ROOT folder of your new dir/sort dir, set true here
#else pictures will stay where they were
#Only applicable if sorting to new dir
move_no_meta = True

#Will use datetime to guess what year/day the picture belongs in
guess_date_from_name=True

#clamp year range.  If dateutil guesses a crazy year (way old or way past current, this will clamp it to between these years
yearRangeOld = 1960
yearRangeNew = 2013

#Dry run will not move anything, just tell you what would happen
dry_run=False
